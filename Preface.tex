This Thesis began as an investigation into the form of the electromagnetic momenta inside a dielectric.  Two competing representations for the form of the momentum were proposed by Abraham and Minkowski over 100 years ago, and yet still the debate continues.  I should mention at the outset of my thesis that it is no longer a question of which representation is correct - they are both correct given the correct context.  The question I wanted to answer was - in what situation is the Minkowski or the Abraham representation appropriate?  
This thesis is an attempt to answer this question, and to shed new light on a centuries old problem.
