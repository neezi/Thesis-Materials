\chapter*{\centerline{Acknowledgements}}
%===================================================
I would first and foremost like to thank my supervisor, Duncan O'Dell, for his support and guidance over the last 6! years. Thanks to my office mates Jesse and Faiyaz for making me realize how weird and dark humans really are when you get to know them.
A big thank you to my two best Hamilton brothers Ray and Rory for reminding me that I'll never get that nature publication.
And to my friends and family back home including the PVC - you guys have been good to me, and I'm grateful for that.
Finally, I wouldn't be here without the wisdom and input I have received from Arjun, Chris Lam, and Betty. Thank you all!
