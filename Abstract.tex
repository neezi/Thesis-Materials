%===================================================

We extend the long-standing Abraham-Minkowski puzzle concerning the momentum of light inside a dielectric medium into the quantum regime by revealing a close connection to the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phase (the quantum phase acquired by a neutral electric dipole moving in a static magnetic field). In order to do this we consider an optical version of the HMW phase that is acquired by a dipole moving in a laser beam, and propose using a triple Bragg grating Mach-Zehnder interferometer to observe it.
